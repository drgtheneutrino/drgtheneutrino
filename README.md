# About Me
Undergraduate Physics student and graduate Health Physics student with a strong passion for math, physics, and chemistry. I enjoy applying scientific thinking to programming projects, especially in algorithmic analysis, nuclear modeling, and automation. I value writing clean, well-structured, and reproducible code.

## Currently Working On
- Working on a radiation dose API calculator taking into account various radiation energies and organs
- Building reproducible research pipelines and automated deployment workflows for nuclear modeling and simulation projects  
- Designing and testing advanced automation frameworks aimed at improving reliability and efficiency in gamma spectroscopy
  
## Goals
- Combine nuclear and health physics knowledge with computational methods for research and applied projects  
- Build robust, automated systems that can run reliably in production or lab environments  
- Continue learning advanced algorithms and expanding data science skills
